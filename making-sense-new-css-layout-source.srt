00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:07,159
simon rex untrue those are some places
you can find more about may I will be

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,650
posting these slides later I'll give you
a link at the end we can get all the

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,260
demo code things I'll be showing you
going fairly quickly through some

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:23,470
examples so I've been working with CSS
and CSS really became a thing since it

5
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:28,238
first appeared in browsers I've been
doing this for that long and with that

6
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,550
kind of history

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,870
CSS today is absolutely amazing we can
do a whole heap of stuff that put off a

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,530
long time we could only do with
Javascript or by you know using a whole

9
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:46,300
stock of sliced up images but CSS layout
seem to get itself stuck somewhere in

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:53,050
about 2006 and essentially we're using
CSS for layout at the moment that was

11
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:58,010
never designed to be used for complex
full-page application layout and that

12
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:04,269
show of hands who here is generally
using some kind of framework bootstrap

13
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:12,189
Foundation also on four grades to the
layout exactly and so we view so awesome

14
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:17,008
the weapon we see this and I know it's
possible to not do this by using Sasha

15
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,439
whatever but if you view so a bootstrap
sites you will see this in the Moscow

16
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,979
and what we're doing here is we are
describing layout in moscow and whether

17
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:31,070
you care you don't care about semantics
last names

18
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:35,029
this is conceptually very heavy and it
makes it hard to do things like new

19
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,329
break points you know for small the
small viewport so whatever tropical

20
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,079
treats quite difficult for doing this in
a moscow who were doing this because

21
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,809
layout is hard and it is fragile and we
have business goals to meet you can't

22
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:55,100
just spent all day playing about with
CSS show ID system layout message they

23
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,899
are costing us and they're costing us
develop ours as we're all learning how

24
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:04,310
to do this stuff the coming at a cost of
an average or dog documents in fully

25
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:10,660
semantic way so so just still matters an
awful lot and they come at a cost of is

26
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,840
leaning on framework to deal with
complexity

27
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,349
and math rising market to our documents
were leaning on three processors and and

28
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:25,910
to abstract away these problems but
there is hope that it comes in the form

29
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,910
of a group of modules that are going to
redefine how we do lay out on the web

30
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:37,489
and these awful Xbox CSS grid layout and
the box alignment module these all our

31
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:44,989
new system for doing layout on the web
when we talk about these new modules we

32
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:49,910
tend to talk in terms of how they solve
our problems and the reason that they

33
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,680
solve these problems is that they shed
some characteristics that characteristic

34
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,120
solve existing last message do not have
they probably separate document so so it

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,560
and be sure to spray they give us true
alignment control they give us the

36
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,750
ability to send two things home has done
to me and they were sponsored by default

37
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:16,379
they remove the need to calculate
percentages to make columnist and most

38
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:22,239
importantly they give relationship to
each other in the context of an oval

39
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,730
layout and this is really important
because a lot of the problems we have

40
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,488
with our existing layout message is
because items in the layout do not

41
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:38,260
understand that the other items in the
layout exist if I float two blocks left

42
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,690
and right and the left one is shorter
than the right 1 I've got no way to tell

43
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,709
the left on block that it should
visually extend to the height of the

44
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:50,239
right how long she doesn't know it's
that didn't know how to lattice we've

45
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,340
been trying to create full height
columns for years maybe some people who

46
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,040
might remember the photo columns
technique using a vertically tiled

47
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,079
background image to create the illusion

48
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,810
version of a full-height column and
these are the techniques of a kind of

49
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,660
stock in trade for the web developer and
have been for years and they really

50
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:16,350
started to fall apart when responsive
came along this relationship is why

51
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:22,840
people jumped on the idea of display
table returned elements into a CSS table

52
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,960
and that gave them relationship because
table of elements not able to have a

53
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,789
relationship to each other and that's
why that kind of work to do things like

54
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,920
full height columns so flexible auction
good take this idea of relationship and

55
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:44,200
they really run with it and that's where
a lot of that power those full height

56
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,430
columns that's pretty much the basic
behavior flex function grid so you got a

57
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,350
simple text books example here we're
taking advantage of the initial default

58
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,380
values of the Flex proper change our
sidebar on our content of in side

59
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,740
effects contained on the Site baldwin's
to the height of the content the

60
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,870
background color goes all the way to the
bottom it doesn't help put behind the

61
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:11,080
text I can do the same with could dry
out just got a great on my rough element

62
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,880
composition in my sidebar my content
using line based positioning should all

63
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,390
of these examples idea of things

64
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:28,340
understanding that place in a wider
layout that's really important as long

65
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:36,419
as we've talked about separation of
content from the display content market

66
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,530
from the way it looks that was kind of
the rallying cry of the CSS layout

67
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,130
movement you trying to persuade our
table using friends that they should

68
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,530
start using this new shiny CSS layout
relevant tables but it's been something

69
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:55,570
of a failed promise we can you have the
ideal source told one display but once

70
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,849
you start dealing with responsive will
try to have multiple displays of that

71
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,210
content it's very difficult to not stop
messing about with the sole soda in

72
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:08,960
order to get the different kinds of this
place that we want to take a look at

73
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,930
flex Fox got my navigation here it's
very simply laid out with the Xbox I'm

74
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,169
using space between

75
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:19,779
Joe flex folks are signing the space
left over after displaying items by

76
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:24,139
fresh direction property is set to row
and that's the initial behavior for Xbox

77
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:30,050
you can also use color just play the
iTunes a column if I want to switch the

78
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,939
order reflects heightened I can set the
Flex direction property to reverse or we

79
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:41,580
could use column of you can also set the
order using the order property so I've

80
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,289
got a bunch of items displaying in short
order in effect container given the

81
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:51,729
model number so you can see that tomoda
we can change the order to now the

82
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:55,139
number 13 visually

83
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,169
gives us the power to change the order
of elements in not one but two

84
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:04,289
dimensions

85
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:08,389
a parent element assets display great
and I'm setting up a three column grid

86
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:15,969
positioning these items using but Colin
grid row property's value before the

87
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:22,259
photo / is the content content starts on
the value after as the land line and

88
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,389
that let's just do something like this

89
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:31,939
positioning items around the grid both
in columns and rows the constraint is

90
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:35,919
the grid items like sex I need to be a
direct route of the element that's

91
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:42,258
become a quick container but the small
so in addition to this placing of items

92
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:47,710
on an explicit grid grid layout also
includes auto placement rules they let

93
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:54,870
us take a chunk of content to upgrade
and the grid will just display for us to

94
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:00,249
the previous example if I remove all
positioning information grid these items

95
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:07,099
will be displayed by could ensure each
in a grid so if I add some more images

96
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:12,128
and some of those images a landscape and
portrait so out of class to any Li

97
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:17,479
elements that contain landscape images
and I can then set the grid column and

98
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:22,159
property to spend two lines so that
means my landscape images now spanned

99
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:27,510
two great tracks and my portrait once
found the default one track and so I get

100
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:34,799
this show in times of registered office
to iTunes report right now we've got one

101
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,049
that takes two trucks and then we've got
a gap because the next image is also

102
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:44,120
landscape it needs to track so by
default grid is progressing forward it's

103
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:51,150
keeping the items in Oranje unless I add
a property of grid auto flow with a

104
00:08:51,150 --> 00:09:00,340
value of dense grid will fill the gas it
moves to the content it finds an image

105
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,910
that will fit a got a toll but he left
it will pick it up and it will pop it

106
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,520
into the space so you can see the item
for now become comes before Lightroom 3

107
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:19,060
in the visual display this is incredibly
powerful and also slightly scary so with

108
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:24,609
this power comes great responsibility
these new methods give us the ability to

109
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:30,140
separate document Jordan display in ways
we have never been able to do before and

110
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,920
we need to start having conversations
about how we do this in an accessible

111
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,849
way because ideally they should make
able to create really great source

112
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,960
documents and then get visual displays
that work well for different devices but

113
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,790
people may just say why don't you worry
about social anymore this will work

114
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,140
whatever I do I can just drag things
around the great that would be bad even

115
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,680
wish because items only become good
items Affleck sites and if they are

116
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:06,790
diabetic child of the container I think
there is a real danger that individuals

117
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:12,400
writing web pages offering tools or
people making JavaScript frameworks will

118
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,840
start to strip Moscow in order to make
it easy and have a flattish or so it is

119
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,510
easier to use these techniques I think
that's a real danger I think it's

120
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,150
something that we should be thinking
about as a community of these new

121
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:30,090
message coming to being this is from the
comment text box editor's draft

122
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,980
explained that order does not change the
logical order of the document it just

123
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:43,420
for the visual display so it appears
that the hardest challenge in web design

124
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,420
is vertical alignment and this is
something that new layout message so

125
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:59,479
this is the safest box alignment module
it's a module that contains the features

126
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,540
of CSS that relate to alignment and it's
basically reflects boxes the alignment

127
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,170
capabilities effects box brought out
they could apply to other layout message

128
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,689
so this is the vertical centering module
although it covers all the things to

129
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,690
like distribution of space overflows
logical positioning

130
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,460
disputes alignment we show one of the
key word values and the simple text

131
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,440
books example in Flex luxurious justify
content and online content to a line

132
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,560
items against one of the two exchanged
I've got navigation in a row and I use

133
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,540
justify content space between to line up
my first and last items flush with the

134
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:48,310
sides of the container and distribute
the rest of the space equally I can you

135
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,130
space around an equal amount of space is
then placed left and right of the items

136
00:11:53,130 --> 00:12:00,540
there's a kind of half size space on
each end by setting a lion or justify

137
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,959
items on the facts contained and we're
changing the Alliance shelf and justify

138
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:11,660
self properties of each of the
individual items inside as you've

139
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,699
already seen

140
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,620
items in effect contain have
relationship by default the value of a

141
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,260
line items will be stretch which means
that item stretching across access and

142
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,630
all the same height despite not
containing content of the same height my

143
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,490
first navigation point that has got a
bit of text in via the things you'll

144
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:37,620
know to go to the same height as that
and other problems 2011 of CSS is doing

145
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,750
vertical centering a line item to send
the item sold center against the main

146
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:52,620
axis direction to call on the line item
sent to ascend to the items I was just

147
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,250
online stuff from using individual flex
items to change that line and properties

148
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:09,300
stretch of them center to get individual
items so this works with Flex folks you

149
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,329
can stop playing around with this you
know you can be using this data and

150
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:17,740
ultimately it's going to apply to all
kinds of layout and so this is

151
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,830
implemented in the grid specs so we can
have a look at how that's working in

152
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:31,470
grid upgrades degrade and I'm setting a
line items on the grid to center we've

153
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,260
got a repeating pattern of great
traction and then positioning my items

154
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:42,220
each grade OE astounding four lines
horizontally and vertically so each of

155
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,860
the full grid via Scopus four squares of
the background image might go see that

156
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,050
was also linked by default the item
without you stretch and fill the hole

157
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:57,410
because your cell line item to send the
items within the hour we can justify the

158
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:03,150
items saying good same placement but
this time we get this kind of alignment

159
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,320
I'm just like with the Xbox you got the
Alliance shell and justify sell

160
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,010
properties and that let you target
individual items and she could really

161
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,100
see how these properties work here

162
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,890
box as shown on the detailed stretch to
cover the gray area is set to launch

163
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:29,160
shelf and seat recline shop start and
day to align self center so we've got

164
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,740
these powerful alignment capabilities
and we can start using a legend for Xbox

165
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,830
the coming to other layout message
ultimately they may well apply to block

166
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:42,209
layout message will probably have the
ability to do things on the web for the

167
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:48,119
first time and being able to align
groups and individual items is really

168
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,370
vital for responsive design but we don't
know maybe how wide that viewport I

169
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,810
swear a lot of all had that kind of work
you know things like the the pho columns

170
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,729
idea is where they started to fall down
once I didn't know how wide that column

171
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,890
was going to be and that's the thing
with these new methods they are

172
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,949
essentially responsive by default

173
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:14,660
I'm sure everyone here knows that
there's a back in 2009 the Eastern

174
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,089
Market detailed and has a list of part
of this technique for creating fluid

175
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:24,560
bridge he was working with relative
phone sizes and note of the grid should

176
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,599
be treated in the same way that we could
divide the target with development by

177
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,060
the whip the context to give us a
percentage to use in place of absolute

178
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,540
sizes four columns in design I'm so it
came to pass that we all started

179
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:45,829
calculating these unlikely looking
numbers and sticking them in all the new

180
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:50,479
layout message was to retire a lot of
those calculations because they can't

181
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,899
just do this stuff for us we've already
seen how the most simple of Xbox

182
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:00,470
examples takes initiative iTunes
declared display flex on them and you

183
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,630
justify content with the value of space
between that value flexes with the

184
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:13,260
available space space as needed but
there's more than that because the Xbox

185
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,840
allows us to portion utley distribute
space between our item

186
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,870
now the Flex property is a shorthand for
three properties we've got flex grow

187
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,870
lecturing and flex basis

188
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,719
text books draft spectra gesture use the
shorthand for these properties because

189
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,650
they will reset the other values to
things that make sense and good company

190
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:43,510
says there's quite a lot of confusion
around these things were so here I am

191
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:49,230
setting flex flex shrink to one and that
means that every box every flex item can

192
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,900
grow and shrink to fit into the space
but the ideal box wit my Flex basis is

193
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:02,160
200 pictures and share this code applied
to some items will give me three boxes

194
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:10,579
of equal with the items to wrap we can
drug to induce mollen see that when the

195
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:16,409
boxes get smaller than 200 pixels a box
will wrap onto line to try and maintain

196
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,709
that 200 pixel basis to the final box
here is taking up all of the Station

197
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:26,459
Road too because the linemen just worked
out on a row by row basic if the vote he

198
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:33,470
has sworn I it's allowed to grow it will
grow it will fill the available space if

199
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:40,570
I don't want the boxes to grow i sat
next row 20 a wide window size my boxers

200
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,429
will just stay at the 200 picture if you
let the boxes wrapped the third item

201
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:50,440
will still drop down but it won't grow
and fill the line and you can talk

202
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,960
individual items to to hear about it
rules for box 300 boxes can grow and

203
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:03,830
shrink to two pixels but box three
cannot grow so you see what happens once

204
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:09,050
the boxes have to stretch wide than 200
pictures it stays 200 pixels the space

205
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:14,310
that's remaining is distributed between
the boxes that have allowed to grow but

206
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,659
there's more than this because
responsive design is about proportions

207
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,190
that's what all option to just about to
in order that we can maintain

208
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,370
proportions elements luxury can assign
different bodies just text grow on

209
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,780
fracturing

210
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,260
I'm setting box 32 flex groped

211
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,520
with my other two boxes that default
reflects Wang

212
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,820
this doesn't mean is that box three
becomes twice the size of the boxes it

213
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,600
means that after the 200 pixel basis has
been taken away from the available

214
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,959
within the container the rest of the
space is assigned to each item across

215
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,960
according to that flex growth factor
that sounds very confusing a good way to

216
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,950
figure it all out

217
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,020
is this play xbox test a tool you can
stick in a load of values and it will

218
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,389
tell you what you would come out with I
want to start playing around with it to

219
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:11,390
make century and once you understand
that you've got a head start to

220
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:18,810
understand FL unit this is a fraction
unit and like flex grow it allows you to

221
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:25,389
assign a fraction of the available space
so that take a quick look at this is my

222
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:31,090
simple grid it defines three columns or
with one out of the way so that creates

223
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:38,399
three equal which color if I change my
definition and create 600 pixels with

224
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,440
columns and absolute side column and
then 21 fraction unit callers great

225
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,360
first gives the fixed width 600 pixels
the remaining space it divides into two

226
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:55,149
and it gives off its one column to the
other if I change my last column 3 fo

227
00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:01,550
the remaining space be divided 243 part
is given to the 301 Park into the water

228
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:07,370
this just light for Xbox means that we
can create fully flexible layout that

229
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:14,580
have so much fixed element in this is
just like the Holy Grail layout that we

230
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,470
used to try and build this was six
sidebars the liquid center weather

231
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,400
center column could be first in the show

232
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:28,870
order but would flex according to screen
with their like this should not seen

233
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:35,010
this in taxable this is the CSS grid
layout Ascot layout template us that CSS

234
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:40,140
gives you a layout on the center column
is set to one fraction unit that will

235
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,419
stretch on take up all of the

236
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:47,940
available which it will look something
like this which is a good 2005 era

237
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,690
layout it's not what wall aiming to
build these days but I feel that given

238
00:20:52,690 --> 00:21:00,159
the history it's nice to know that we
can finally do it so it's a new system

239
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,429
for layout I think it raises a huge
amount of different possibilities I'm

240
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:09,559
very excited to see what happens it gets
into the hands of people who are

241
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:13,570
creative with their stuff well some
people like me who can just build things

242
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,689
we've got great we've got the Xbox and
then that's tied together with the

243
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:24,220
alignment of space distribution
properties from Fox alignment the key

244
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,090
difference between these two specs
people often say oh well which should I

245
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,119
be using should I use an ideal world
wanted got them both would I be using

246
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:39,320
Flex boxer would I use trade show for
Xbox is for one dimensional layout thats

247
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,509
things that can be laid out in a row or
laid out in a column although it was

248
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:50,830
essentially still got an unbroken line
which is for two-dimensional layout so

249
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:58,178
you working with was calling the
simplest example of this if we're at of

250
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:04,009
items using Flex books I've got a flex
basis here of 200 pixels and the items

251
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:11,090
are allowed to grow and shrink I have
got five items what happens here the

252
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:16,019
Flex items rap show each row start
acting like a new facts contained I'm

253
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:19,450
space distribution happens across the
row that's how it works

254
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,149
show at the top line we've got three
items and then we go to the next line

255
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:27,508
we've only got two items that allowed to
grow so it's different and they spread

256
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:31,470
out across there and then people say oh
well actually what I'd like to be able

257
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:37,409
to do is line up those two bottom iTunes
underneath the items at the top and

258
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:42,070
fresh box doesn't do this because it's
dealing with issues of unbroken line

259
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,799
which is where you want grid layout if
you want to do something like this

260
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:49,720
because she wanted to control both rows
and columns

261
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,399
with grid layout you do something like
this you wouldn't do anything with the

262
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,590
item is it all be controlled when you're
creating the grid and then the items

263
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,209
would be flown in flowed into it and
that would give you this kind of layout

264
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,830
so unless you actually especially said
something I want you to span across to

265
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:20,250
the column tracks you get them in single
trucks so this wonderful new goodness

266
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:26,180
reflects folks house that she got really
great for our sport at this point if you

267
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:31,760
can use your browser's you can use your
Xbox even if you have to sport old

268
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,300
browsers it's very possible to use quite
a lot of flex box has essentially an

269
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,200
enhancement to your layout soyuz older
methods and then be tweaked the

270
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,880
alignment and get things look pretty
tight using the Xbox but really everyone

271
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,630
should probably starting to use some
degree reflects box in their work at

272
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:54,170
this point because its bid got really
good support it's worth doing so proud

273
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:59,080
to offer grid layout not so good the
only browser that has any implementation

274
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:06,159
which is sort of live is I 1011 edge and
that is because the suspect came from

275
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,260
Microsoft they crashed early
implementation of it in those brushes

276
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:15,730
but it is quite different now to the the
current specification sheet was

277
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:21,310
essentially the very first
implementation of the spec for the best

278
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:25,909
stuff to work with is in chrome and
regular chrome but it's behind a

279
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:31,250
flagship need to enable the experimental
web platform features flag and then lots

280
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,260
of demos all things stuck shoney's today
you can have a look at them play about

281
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:39,890
with that would in blink show it should
chrome and opera is being done by

282
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:45,880
earlier sponsored by Bloomberg they're
also doing the work in WebKit WebKit

283
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,810
nightlies how quickly that enables you
need to use a WebKit prefix grades on

284
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:56,129
the edge backlog at high priority so I'm
assuming that intending to bring the

285
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:00,680
implementation up to the same spec
nothing else and Mozilla are currently

286
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,820
implementing great in Firefox quite a
lot of these examples work in Firefox

287
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,429
tonight

288
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:10,770
please adjust to a party fell out there
so great is coming and unlike flex books

289
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:15,060
which kind of trickled out it kind of
heartbroken states and changed and goes

290
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:19,429
already confused which has been
developed behind flags so when it does

291
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:24,740
eventually shift and browses it should
be fairly equal across browsers and very

292
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,420
complete and it's been kind of kept
behind the flag so that we don't have

293
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,300
this problem of it emerging in this
which is good news for when it does

294
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,220
arrive we can start using it with some
confidence it we've gotten your problem

295
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:44,080
just use it with I have lots and lots of
great examples to play with if you want

296
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:50,710
to go and have a look good by
example.com is why I keep all of my good

297
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:54,940
examples I can't put new ones up and I'd
love to have more people looking at this

298
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,670
stuff in particular who got an interest
in accessibility it's not my of

299
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:02,570
expertise not to love to see more
conversations happening around you know

300
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,879
using these new last message and
accessibility think it's a very very

301
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,860
important subject I have got a office
hours thing at lunch so very happy to

302
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:16,500
have a chat about any of this stuff and
you will find my slides all the code

303
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,610
examples of that year and you can always
treated me on Twitter or drop me a line

304
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,409
of talking about this stuff thank you
very much for listening
